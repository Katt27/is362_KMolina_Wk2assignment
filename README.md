# Recursion Explained in Python - Jupyter Notebook

## Overview

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook **"Recursion Explained"** by K. Molina. The notebook explains the concept of recursion using Python with detailed examples. Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a larger problem. The notebook includes multiple examples and explanations to help users understand how recursion works in practice.

## Contents of the Notebook

1. **Introduction to Recursion**:
   - An overview of recursion, its benefits, and the structure of a recursive function (base case and recursive case).

2. **Factorial Example**:
   - A Python implementation of the factorial function using recursion.
   - A detailed breakdown of how recursion helps compute the factorial of a number.

3. **Fibonacci Sequence**:
   - A recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence.
   - An explanation of how the Fibonacci sequence is computed recursively and a discussion of its inefficiency due to repeated calculations.

4. **Sum of Digits Example** (or another new example you may have added):
   - A recursive function that calculates the sum of digits of a number.
   - This example demonstrates how recursion can simplify certain mathematical operations.

5. **Common Pitfalls**:
   - A section discussing common issues when using recursion, such as infinite recursion, inefficiency, and large memory usage.
   - Brief notes on improving recursive functions using techniques like memoization (if applicable).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Summary of key concepts and takeaways about recursion and how to apply it effectively in Python.
