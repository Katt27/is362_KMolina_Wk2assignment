# Recursion Explained in Python - Jupyter Notebook

## Overview

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook **"Recursion Explained"** by K. Molina. The notebook provides an educational overview of recursion, illustrating key concepts with practical Python examples. Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. 

### Filename: 
- `is362_KMolina_RecursionExplained.ipynb`

## Contents of the Notebook

1. **Introduction to Recursion**:
   - A brief explanation of recursion, its usefulness, and the structure of a recursive function (base case and recursive case).

2. **Factorial Example**:
   - A Python implementation of the factorial function using recursion. 
   - Explanation and visualization of how recursion works step by step to compute factorial.

3. **Fibonacci Sequence**:
   - Recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence.
   - Demonstrates how recursion can lead to inefficiency due to repeated calculations in some cases.

4. **Common Pitfalls**:
   - Discussion on potential issues when using recursion, such as forgetting the base case or causing infinite recursion.

5. **Efficiency and Tail Recursion**:
   - A note on the efficiency of recursive solutions, especially for problems like Fibonacci, and the lack of tail recursion optimization in Python.

## How to Use the Notebook
